WinEdt is a powerful and versatile text editor for Windows with a strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents...

WinEdt is used as a front-end for compilers\footnote{A software that compiles!} and typesetting systems, such as TeX, HTML or NSIS. WinEdt's highlighting schemes can be customized for different modes and its spell checking functionality supports multilingual setups, with dictionaries (word lists) for many languages available for downloading from WinEdt's Community Site www.winedt.org. Contributions are welcome!

Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt has been specifically designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with a TeX System (such as MiKTeX or TeX Live). However, WinEdt's documentation does not cover TeX-related topics in depth; you'll find introductions and manuals on typesetting with TeX, as well as links to other recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site (TUG). For LaTeX-related issues visit LaTeX Community Forum: questions are welcome and help is forthcoming!
