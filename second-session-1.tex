Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt has been specifically designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with a TeX System (such as MiKTeX or TeX Live). However, WinEdt's documentation does not cover TeX-related topics in depth; you'll find introductions and manuals on typesetting with TeX, as well as links to other recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site (TUG). For LaTeX-related issues visit LaTeX Community Forum: questions are welcome and help is forthcoming!
